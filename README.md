**Note to the reviewer:**
This task doesn't put any restrictions on using technologies - only a data structure to work with. This seemed interesting to me and I had some free time on my weekend to code and play around this task. I used `create-react-app` to speed up my development. Also I used open source library for chat components for the same reason.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
