## Update 17.04.2020:

Pushed explicit commit history to the repo. I was told that absence of commit history is one of reasons of declining my work - so I decided to add it. Initial task description didn't say that commit history is mandatory - so I preferred to hide my development process and squash history into one commit.

If there are also some other reasons for declining my work - could you please give a feedback - what's wrong or inaprropriate - so I can blame myself and learn to do my work better.

I thought about some additional features to this task which could be also implemented:

- Node.js server with some DB connected
- Code splitting
- Better chat components, parsing emoji etc
- Better styles
- Better/stronger Typescript
- Internationalization
- 100% unit tests coverage (there are some unit tests in `tests` folder for components and sagas but coverage is not 100%)
- E2E tests

Unfortunately, there are some time constraints that I have - due to my current project, so I didn't have enough time to add these features. But if something from the list is desirable - I could easily implement it on my weekend.

Thanks and best regards!

**Note to the reviewer:**
This task doesn't put any restrictions on using technologies - only a data structure to work with. This seemed interesting to me and I had some free time on my weekend to code and play around this task. I used `create-react-app` to speed up my development. Also I used open source library for chat components for the same reason.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
